The objective of the app is to make communication possible between a deaf person and a normal person who doesnâ€™t know how to use American Sign Language to communicate with deaf person. We convert the audio provided text given by the normal person to text and gif/video array which is understandable for the deaf person. This application aims to remove third person from which was required in a Voice Carry Over and maintain communication privacy and does not need extra device to be carried.
